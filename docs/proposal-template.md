# Introduction

Build an app that allows the users to express their creativity through pixelized art. Users can utilize the touch feature to turn pixels individual colors through an integrated color picker, 24 bit RGB/Hexadecimal. To stat the grid would be 8x8. The app would have an export feature that would allow them to share out their creations via social media. We would like to integrate the accelerometer to detect shake to undo the last mark that was made. 

We are thinking about using a login feature through google to sync past creations through firebase so users can see past work. Optimistically we would like to create a feature where the user could choose this grid size for more freedom, as well as a custom RGB text box for more colors.

# Estimated Timeline (updated 10/6/2021)
- 10/13 - Color picker
- 10/20 - Pixel grid
- 11/03 - Shake to undo
- 12/01 - Dynamic grid size
- 12/08 - Cloud functionalities

## OLD TIMELINE (for archival purposes)
- Design requirements (9/22)
- Basic static Functionality (UI 10/6)
- Basic colors (10/13)
- 8x8 grid (10/20)
- Shake to undo (11/3)
- Custom RGB (12/1)
- dynmic grid (Optional integration if time 12/8)
- Cloud functionality (Optional integration if time 12/8)

# Anticipated Problems

- Shake
- Dynamic Grid size
- Danielle's learning curve to remember coding
- Learning how to do mobile app dev. as a group
- Git Hub struggles
- Time to meet
- Getting it to work on apple/android and web
- Working on someone else's timeline (partners)

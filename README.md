## Project Overview

A pixel art mobile app in which users can draw pictures by changing the colors of cells on a grid, and save and export their creations.

This application allows the users to express their creativity through pixelized art. Users can utilize the touch feature to turn pixels individual colors through an integrated color picker, 24 bit RGB/Hexadecimal. To stat the grid would be 8x8. The app would have an export feature that would allow them to share out their creations via social media. We are going to integrate the accelerometer to detect shake to undo the last mark that was made.

Ideally, we will be utilizing a login feature through google to sync past creations through firebase so users can see past work. Then in future development, we would like to create a feature where the user could choose this grid size for more freedom, as well as a custom RGB text box for more colors.
